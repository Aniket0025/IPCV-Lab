**Repository Structure**

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt): Python dependencies for the notebooks and examples.
- [OpenCV/EXP-1/practice.ipynb](OpenCV/EXP-1/practice.ipynb): Experiment 1 — practice notebook.
- [OpenCV/EXP-2/Exp2.ipynb](OpenCV/EXP-2/Exp2.ipynb): Experiment 2 notebook.



**Getting Started**

1. Install Python 3.8+ (3.10 recommended).
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
3. Install dependencies:
